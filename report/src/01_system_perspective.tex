A description and illustration of the:

    Design and architecture of your ITU-MiniTwit systems
    All dependencies of your ITU-MiniTwit systems on all levels of abstraction and development stages. That is, list and briefly describe all technologies and tools you applied and depend on.
    Important interactions of subsystems.
        For example, via an illustrative UML Sequence diagram that shows the flow of information through your system from user request in the browser, over all subsystems, hitting the database, and a response that is returned to the user.
        Similarly, another illustrative sequence diagram that shows how requests from the simulator traverse your system.
    Describe the current state of your systems, for example using results of static analysis and quality assessments.


MSc students should argue for the choice of technologies and decisions for at least all cases for which we asked you to do so in the tasks at the end of each session.

\subsection{Dependencies, Technologies \& Rationale}
All dependencies and technologies are shown on Table 1 and Table 2.
\begin{comment}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Microsoft ASP.NET Core~8 (Web API)}\cite{web-api-tutorial} – A framework for building RESTful web services using C\# and .NET. Compared to Node/Express, it provides static typing, built‑in dependency injection, and higher baseline throughput in Linux containers.
        
        \item \textbf{Entity Framework Core~8 (Code‑First)}\cite{Entity-Framework-Core} – An object–relational mapper that maps .NET objects to SQL tables and handles migrations. Compared to lightweight mappers like Dapper, its automatic migrations and LINQ queries remove boilerplate while still allowing raw SQL when required.
        
        \item \textbf{Blazor WebAssembly (stand‑alone)}\cite{blazor} – Runs C\# directly in the browser via WebAssembly with no JavaScript bundle. Compared to a React+TypeScript front‑end, it keeps the entire stack in one language and reuses existing DTOs.
        
        \item \textbf{SignalR}\cite{signalr} – Real‑time library that pushes server updates to clients over WebSockets or graceful fall‑backs. 
        
        \item \textbf{Tailwind CSS}\cite{tailwind} – A utility‑class framework applied directly in markup. Compared to Bootstrap, its purge step removes unused styles, shrinking the CSS bundle and keeping component markup concise.
        
        \item \textbf{Docker}\cite{docker} – Packages the app and its dependencies into containers, ensuring identical development and production environments. Compared to shell scripts on raw VMs, it eliminates “works on my machine” drift and enables one‑command integration test environments.
        
        \item \textbf{DigitalOcean}\cite{digitalocean} – Cloud provider offering computing, storage, and managed MySQL. We chose it over Azure and Google Cloud, because it was the only service we could get up and running successfully.
        
        \item \textbf{GitHub Actions}\cite{github_actions} – CI/CD that runs tests, lints, builds images, and deploys on every pull request. Compared to Jenkins, it requires no self‑hosted server or plugin maintenance.
        
        \item \textbf{MySQL}\cite{mysql} – Relational database engine powering production. Compared to PostgreSQL, the team already knew its tooling and DigitalOcean offers it as a fully managed service.
        
        \item \textbf{xUnit}\cite{xUnit} – Unit‑testing framework for .NET with a clean attribute syntax. Compared to MSTest or NUnit, it executes tests in parallel out of the box and integrates tightly with the .NET CLI.
        
        \item \textbf{Serilog}\cite{serilog} – Structured logging library that writes JSON to files, Seq, or Grafana/Loki. Compared to the default Microsoft logger, it produces queryable, schema‑less logs without extra adapters.
        
        \item \textbf{SnapShooter}\cite{snapshooter} – Backup service creating scheduled and on‑demand snapshots of volumes and databases. Compared to a hand‑rolled \texttt{mysqldump}+\emph{cron}, it handles retention policies and one‑click restores for us.

    The team already had hands‑on experience with .NET, C\#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Blazor, SignalR, Tailwind CSS, GitHub Actions, MySQL, and xUnit. That familiarity shortened onboarding time, and we also naturally gravitated toward technologies that integrate smoothly with the wider .NET ecosystem when evaluating alternatives.
